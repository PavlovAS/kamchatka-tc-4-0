              trekking routes to beautiful wild places, rafting along mountain
              rivers, fishing, sea cruises.

              "Kamchatka Travel Club" company was founded in 2008 by Pavlov
              Alexander. "About me. I was born in Kamchatka and started
              travelling here in the age of 12. While studying in Moscow State
              University during summer holidays I organised some trekking routes
              in Kamchatka for my friends. I also took part in some Kamchatka
              expeditions, for example 3-weeks ski-tour to the Valley of the
              Geysers, about 300 kilometres skiing. In 2008 I started working as
              a travel guide in my own company. Since that time the company has
              been grown much bigger, now we have many experienced and
              professional guides, drivers, we keep improving our services from
              year to year according to our experience and recommendations of
              our clients. We are sure in our best performance and the high
              quality of our tours. On the other hand we try to propose
              competitive prices.
